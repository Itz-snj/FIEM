## 🔧 Configuration

### Health Check Intervals
- **System Health Check:** Every 5 minutes
- **Alert Processing:** Real-time
- **Metric Aggregation:** On-demand with caching

### Alert Thresholds
- **Memory Usage:** Alert at 80% utilization
- **Response Time:** Alert if average > 5 minutes
- **Error Rate:** Alert if > 5% (critical at > 10%)
- **Driver Availability:** Alert if < 5 active drivers
- **Pending Bookings:** Alert if > 10 pending

### Data Retention
- **Alerts:** Last 1000 alerts in memory
- **Health Checks:** Last 100 checks in memory
- **Metrics:** Calculated on-demand from database

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
node analytics-monitoring-test.js
```

The test script validates:
- All 13 comprehensive analytics endpoints
- All 8 monitoring and alerting endpoints  
- All 5 existing analytics endpoints
- Manual health check triggering

### Expected Results
- **100% Success Rate:** All endpoints operational
- **80-99% Success Rate:** Minor issues, mostly functional
- **<80% Success Rate:** Significant issues requiring attention

## 🚨 Alert Escalation

### Critical Alert Handling
Critical alerts trigger automatic escalation:

1. **Immediate Logging** - Error-level logging with full context
2. **Console Alerts** - Visible system notifications
3. **Future Integration Points:**
   - SMS notifications to on-call engineers
   - Slack/Teams channel alerts
   - Email notifications to management
   - PagerDuty integration

### Alert Lifecycle
1. **Creation** - Alert generated with severity and context
2. **Acknowledgment** - On-call team acknowledges alert
3. **Investigation** - Root cause analysis and remediation
4. **Resolution** - Issue resolved and alert closed
5. **Post-mortem** - Analysis for prevention

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Aggregation Pipelines** - Efficient MongoDB queries
- **In-Memory Caching** - Recent data stored in memory
- **Lazy Loading** - Metrics calculated on-demand
- **Pagination** - Large datasets returned in chunks

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Service can be replicated
- **Database Optimization** - Efficient indexing and queries
- **Memory Management** - Automatic cleanup of old data
- **Load Balancing** - Stateless service design

## 🔐 Security & Access

### Authentication
- Admin-level access required for sensitive endpoints
- Role-based access control for different metric types
- API key authentication for automated monitoring

### Data Privacy
- No sensitive user data exposed in analytics
- Aggregated metrics only, no individual tracking
- GDPR compliance for analytics data

## 🚀 Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. Ensure MongoDB connectivity
2. Configure alert thresholds in environment variables
3. Set up log rotation for monitoring data
4. Configure external alerting integrations

### Production Considerations
- **Monitoring the Monitor** - Secondary health checks
- **Alert Fatigue Prevention** - Intelligent alert grouping
- **Disaster Recovery** - Backup monitoring systems
- **Performance Impact** - Minimal overhead on main services

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Basic Health Check
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/monitoring/health');
const health = await response.json();
console.log(`System Status: ${health.data.status}`);
```

### Get Critical Alerts
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/monitoring/alerts/critical');
const alerts = await response.json();
alerts.data.forEach(alert => {
  console.log(`CRITICAL: ${alert.title} - ${alert.message}`);
});
```

### Analytics Dashboard Data
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/comprehensive-analytics/overview');
const analytics = await response.json();
console.log(`Total Bookings: ${analytics.data.usage.totalBookings}`);
console.log(`Avg Response Time: ${analytics.data.responseTime.avgResponseTime}min`);
```
